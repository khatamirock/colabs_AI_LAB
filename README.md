# colabs_AI_LAB DT
the Decision Tree Implementation from SCRATCH on machine learning LAB-work
### this generates the tree ðŸŽ„ model from dataset file and ACUTUALLY # learns from that data
### so when we give it some feature in a list=>> feature = ['36-55', 'master', 'high', 'single']
##$ this predicts the result accordingly to the tree 
### developed Tree model on Terminal
